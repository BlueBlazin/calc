I'm making a very simple calculator to learn C++. Nothing more, nothing less.

# Log

The plan is to make it increasingly complex by adding functionality over time.

1. Implement a Reader to read a file one character at a time.
2. Implement a simple Tokenizer to convert source into tokens.
3. Implement Parser with precedence climbing binary expression parsing.
4. Implement a single Eval function.
